            ## Maintainer Checklist

            The following is a checklist for maintainers to make sure this process goes as well as possible. Feel free to address the points below yourself in further commits if you realize that actions are needed :)

            - [ ] The [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Server/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) has been updated with a description of the changes for the upcoming release and the corresponding issue (if necessary)
            - [ ] The PR passes all required Continuous Integration (CI) checks
            - [ ] Test coverage output has been reviewed in the GitHub Actions logs under the "Run tests and show coverage" step

            ## First PR Commit Check

            - [ ] The commit messages for the remote branch should be checked to make sure the contributor's email is set up correctly so that they receive credit for their contribution
            - The contributor's name and icon in remote commits should be the same as what appears in the PR
            - If there's a mismatch, the contributor needs to make sure that the [email they use for GitHub](https://github.com/settings/emails) matches what they have for `git config user.email` in their local Scribe-Server repo (can be set with `git config --global user.email "GITHUB_EMAIL"`)
